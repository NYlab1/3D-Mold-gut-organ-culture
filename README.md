# 3D-Mold-gut-organ-culture
We created a device for three dimensional intestinal organ culture and experimentation. The custom-fabricated fluidic chip holds up to six individual gut tissue fragments in isolated chambers. Each chamber is 8 mm wide and 25 mm long to accommodate mouse gut fragments of varying sizes and to provide a bath of nutrients. The lid is patterned so that it precisely matches the outer dimensions of the fluidic chip. Both the chip and the lid are made from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS; Sylgard 184) by replica molding of a 3D printed master. The masters were designed using AutoDesk-360 software.
